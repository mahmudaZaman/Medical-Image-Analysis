## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to apply transfer learning to pre-trained medical image classification models for diagnosing specific diseases, with a particular focus on diseases like Pneumonia. I aim to harness the power of existing knowledge encoded in deep learning models to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

## Dataset

For this project, I utilized  Chest X-rays(from Kaggle), for diagnosing diseases like Pneumonia containing labeled images. These datasets served as the foundation for training and fine-tuning the models to achieve precise disease diagnosis.

## Model

Employing the power of TensorFlow, I constructed a robust system for predicting Pneumonia in medical images, capitalizing on the strengths of pre-trained models. These pre-existing models bring heightened accuracy and efficiency to diagnostic processes, leveraging their vast knowledge gained from extensive training on diverse datasets.

## AWS Integration With Amazon S3

I've seamlessly integrated Amazon Web Services (AWS) into this project to leverage their cutting-edge tools and capabilities. The trained model has been securely stored on AWS S3 for efficient accessibility. In addition, a user-friendly interface has been developed using Streamlit, enabling users to upload Chest X-ray images. The underlying model, loaded directly from AWS S3, predicts the likelihood of Pneumonia, enhancing user interaction and diagnostic capabilities.

## Why This Project Matters

Medical Image Analysis has the potential to transform healthcare by providing more accurate and faster disease diagnoses. By leveraging transfer learning and AWS services, I'm making strides toward improving patient outcomes, reducing healthcare costs, and ultimately saving lives.
